An environmental scientist using the virtual world to solve problems in the physical one. I primarily use Python/SQL; visualize in Tableau.

## Interests 

I enjoy a plethora of outdoor activities including trail running, backpacking, mountaineering, kayaking, climbing, and mountain biking. I am happiest off the concrete and on the grass.

## Current Focus

I am in the process of delving deeper into data analytics. This involves a measured focus on back-end development using Python, SaaS, and SQL while visualizing in Tableau. My current code editor is Visual Studio. I am hoping to parlay my programming knowledge into ArcGIS to create dynamic maps that display a wide breadth of information at a glance.

## In 5 years...

I hope to become an environmental data analyst and cross interagency boundaries to inform scientists and the public alike of impending and current environmental issues. I believe that data is the future and embracing it will pave the path through many problems.
